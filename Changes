Revision history for Abilities

{{$NEXT}}
	- Now using Any::Moose 'Role' instead of Moose::Role
	- Actions can now have options. When an action doesn't have any options,
	  then it's really a yes/no option. When an action does have options,
	  then it's no longer a yes/no option. This allows more finer grained
	  control over actions, and caused a (backwards-compatible) change
	  to the can_perform() method. More details in the docs.
